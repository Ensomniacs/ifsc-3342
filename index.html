        <h2><em>In Review</em></h2>
        <p class="review">When starting the our final project, I knew in concept what I wanted the page to look like, as seen inthe FIGMA prototype. Very similar to the way in which Bungie sets up their seasonal pages for their seasonal content.
            Initially, I had conceptualized adding several spaces including reward tiers, information about "content" included with this <em>fan-made SIVA season</em> for Destiny 2. 
        </p>
        <p class="review">Over time with developing the concept, working with Bootstrap, and working alongside the team, I discovered that some of the conceptualization for the project did not have as many assets that would fill in the space. 
            I got rid a few of the sections including reward tiers for a "Season Pass", the "Pass Holders" content, and adjusted the media gallery after I tested response time. When i started the rapid prototype, I went straight into the CSS to change the colours of everything to match the theme.</p>
        <p class="review">I also realized that the more that I worked on the project under the "rapid prototype," the more I strayed myself away from the goal of that initial assigment. The website for <strong>Season of the Plague</strong> eventually had shifted into being a host for a community lead ARG.
        Banding together with one of the mods from RaidSecrets on Discord along with all of the talented artists on the team, we released in sequence 17 puzzle pieces for the RaidSecrets community to decipher in order to unlock early access to our project discord server prior to the launch of our final trailer.</p>
        <p class="review">Upon the release of the website, I noticed that the response time was severly declining on loads. As a result of this, I had to shift around to better accomodate both the assets included with the website along with the experience of the over 2000 users who were accessing the site. 
            In the first day of launch, nealry 1,700 people had accessed the site. By 7pm that evening, I had released a <a href="https://ensomniacs.github.io/Seasonoftheplague/specialthanks.html"><strong>Special Thank You</strong></a> to the community along side a <a href="https://forms.gle/Vx4tC41WvpvSuGPD7"><strong>User Expereince feedback</strong></a> form for anyone inclined to provide feedback on how the site interacted with them on ther platform of choice.</p>
        <p class="review">This allowed me to receive some feedback about experience other than just "It looks great!" One person in particular who went by the handle of "Tredinator" or Mat in our discord provided the most feedback in how to make the experience more pleasurable for the viewer. So instead of a mass gallery at the bottom, they suggested using a carousel, provided code they modified from follwing W3, and I fine tuned it with matching the codes provided through Bootstrap already being pre-loaded.</p>
        <p class="review">The repo for this project is also public for review by anyone who wishes to access it. Not all of the assets created for the project were used on the final page, primarily due to the response time still being long with the use of JavaScript and Youtube embeds. However, this was a pleasureable working experience and we have now since formed a production group called <a href="https://twitter.com/ArripeGladium"><strong>Arripe Gladium</strong></a>.</p>
        <p class="review">We hope that in our coming months and years that we gain the experience and knowledge to support not only each other in our endevours but strive for our goals to work in the gaming industry one day.<br>Thank you for participating in this project, and thank you for allowing the opportunity to steam drive this forward with the education you've provided for me this semester.</p>
